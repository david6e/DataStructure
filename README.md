# Data Structure
---
This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in Java. Each structure is accompanied by practical examples and explanations of its applications, performance, and complexity. The goal of this project is to serve as a reference and foundation for learning and delving deeper into structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and more.
